#Lightning Talks / Whiteboarding Practice 

We will be starting lightning talks on various topics. Generally, each talk will be presented at the beginning of class on a subject that we are about to learn about. In other words, you get first crack at explaining a new thing to your classmates. You have the opportunity to contribute your voice, experience, and perspective in the classroom in a new way. Furthermore, you get practice at being nervous in front of people while having to explain code, programming concepts, or other related concepts.

###Requirements
- 3-5 minute time limit
- You must write code or draw an explanatory diagram on the whiteboard during your presentation
- The talk should be as accurate as you can possibly make it. Talk about the parts of the topic that you think you understand the best. After all, it's only a minimum of three minutes.
- New Requirement: No powerpoint slides please
